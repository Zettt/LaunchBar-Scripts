-- this script display a growl message after a given delay time
--
-- Usage: Call LaunchBar, Hit Space, Input your message and provied your delay time at the end in "3s", "1m" or "2d" (without quotes) 
-- Example: "This is an example message 2s" (without quotes)

-- take string from LaunchBar
on handle_string(message)
	set future_message to message as text
	
	-- how much delay do we need?
	set delay_word to last word of message
	
	tell application "LaunchBar"
		-- Encode message for URL; strip delay time
		do shell script "/usr/bin/python -c 'import sys, urllib; print urllib.quote(unicode(sys.argv[1], \"utf8\"))' " & quoted form of (text 1 thru ((length of message) - ((length of delay_word) + 1)) of message)
		set delay_time to result
		
		-- Determine seconds, minutes, hours or days
		set time_multiplier to 1
		if last character of delay_word = "m" then set time_multiplier to 60
		if last character of delay_word = "h" then set time_multiplier to 60 * 60
		if last character of delay_word = "d" then set time_multiplier to 60 * 60 * 24
		set delay_value to text 1 thru ((length of delay_word) - 1) of delay_word
		
		-- delay the message
		delay delay_word
		
	end tell
	
	-- display growl message
	my growlRegister()
	my growlNotify("LaunchBar", future_message)
