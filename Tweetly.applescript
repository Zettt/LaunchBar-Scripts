--   This script was put together with the help of the following sources:
--   http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/ by Coda Hale
--   http://i.grahamenglish.net/540/iquicktwitter-my-quicksilver-twitter-ichat-growl-hack/ by Graham English
--   http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2009/02/url-shortening-scripts-fixed-i-think/ by @drdrang (fix for &ampersand issues)
--   put together and adapted by @ptujec to work with LaunchBar
--   minor changes to convert urls to tiny versions by @ctwise (http://tedwise.com)
--   Some additions by @zettt (http://www.zettt.de): 
-- 		1. Copy the tweet to the clipboard if the tweet exceeds 140 character count. (for extra safeness)
--		2. Shorten links to https:// sites 
--		3. Now you dont have to provide a link at the end of your tweet. This script checks if there is a link on your clipboard and pastes that one at the end of your tweet. In order to work you have to provide a "y" at the end of your tweet to check clipboard. "y" stands for "yes check clipboard" or similiar. ;)
